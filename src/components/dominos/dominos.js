          <h3>Interaction Design Prototype</h3>
          <p>The project was centered around inclusive design for Microsoft, mainly we were interested in creating UIs for people
            who were not the typical users, as so we thought about how to do that. I decided to focuse on people who has
            visual problems, either they had difficulties seeing or they were blinded.

            The application that was to be designed to be more inclusive was the Dominosâ€™s Pizza Application.</p>

          <h3>Samsung Voice Assistant</h3>
          <p>Additionally I created the prototype with AngularJS and HTML/CSS/JS. Now that the application was able to be coded, I
            decided to use a solution that would use code to implement of a solution for inclusive design. I created some custom code
            with HTML and CSS that created an indivisible div, that would not be able to be seen in the visual interface.

            The code would be activated using the Samsung Voice Assistant. When the voice assistant was activated, the user can
            activate the invisible div, will read out the instructions of various things on the app that would be able to able to
            seen and read the elements.</p>

            I worked on the onboarding of the mobile app. For this I designed it based on some sketches
            and created a higher fidelity for them. After I created the Rapid Prototype for them using Proto.io.</p>

          <p>I decidede to create this prototype using the
            original designs, then for the indivudals whom
            had difficulties seeing I decided to increase the
            sizes of the elements, particuarly using more
            the screen to stretch the elements for more
            visibility, although this would make the
            appearance of the application would not
            be as nice.</p>

          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>Various steps to this application. We started with the sketches because the Microsoft Inclusive Designs had personas
            that we were designing for. Mainly the Personas was for a person whom be blind or visually impaired, hard to see.
            After the sketches were done, based on the original app. We tried to come up with various solutions that would be
            able to solve the problems. After the designs were better designed, we did some testing, using user testing, we
            tested the interface with users and we were able to see what users thought about the application, and we also
            got a heat map to see where the user would be clicking on the interface.</p>

          <h3>Implementation
            of the Interface</h3>
          <p>I was not satisfied with the solution, I think
            I needed something more than something
            that would be just some static file. I wanted
            an prototype that would be actually usable
            and then I could implement an additional
            solution using code.

            So I created the HTML/CSS and JS prototype,
            implementing with AngularJS. After I created
            that prototype, I saw that using the andriod
            device I could activate the voice assistant using
            certain finger gestures.

            I implemented the invisible CSS div that was
            able to be only be seen using the voice
            assistant.</p>

          <h3>Completion of the
            Prototype</h3>
          <p>The prototype was created and I was able
            to present it in class, and I think based
            on the case files it could be a possible
            solution for user.</p>

          <h3>Designing and
            Implementing</h3>
          <p>Designing and implementing this prototype
            gave me a sense of happiness, knowing
            that I was designing something that would
            help a Personas that needs more care
            than others. Im happy to see people being
            helped, and I think that after I was able to
            create this interface using code it really opened
            up more possiblities for a solution that would
            be possible for user.</p>
