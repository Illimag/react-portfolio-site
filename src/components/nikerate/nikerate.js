          <h3>React Web Application</h3>
          <p>This was a personal personal project because
            I wanted to really go indepth into the React.JS
            framework. Understanding what was going on.
            I decided to recreate the React.JS web app
            from scratch.

            Nike Rate is based on a conceptual Web app
            that can be used by individuals that are
            interested in Nike shoes. They can go on the
            platform and then they can start to figure out
            what types of shoes they are interested in
            and they can start ranking the shoes based
            on who gets the most clicks.</p>

          <p>Series of various UI designs, Initially I designed some low level mockups that were
            brought into the fold to be sued on the production application. It was a growing experience.
            I worked on the onboarding of the mobile app. For this I designed it based on some sketches
            and created a higher fidelity for them. After I created the Rapid Prototype for them using Proto.io.</p>

          <h3>Designing the User Interface</h3>
          <p>Can I design a better User Interface based on the
            React.JS source code and then can I develop it from
            scratch based on the docs. They project is a
            React.JS Web app that is custom designed and
            also built with Bootstrap 4, then it is deployed with
            Heroku. This app is built as a concept for individual
            who has an interest in Nike shoes.

            With the web app they can rate a show up or down
            depending on what they think of the shoes in
            relation to other shoes on the application.</p>

          <h3>Source code</h3>
          <p>I took the application apart based on the
            source code. Then I built it from scartch using
            React.JS/HTML/CSS/JS. After I rebuilt it, I then
            rebuilt the UI with Bootstrap. After I finished
            developing the prototype, I deployed it using
            Heroku.

            I also custom designed the application thinking
            about design methodology such as flat design,
            so I used cards to showcase each individual shoe.
            I finished up the design using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

          <h3>Completion of the Application</h3>
          <p>After completing this application, I was happy because I started to see that I was able to build out and app
            using React.JS and use that for custom UI Components to design a custom UI Interface. I was pretty happy
            that everything worked as I intended and I thought the designs came out nice as well. I was really happy that
            my designs were able to be used as intended for React.JS as UI components, but additionally that the designs
            would follow somewhat what was for React.JS.</p>
