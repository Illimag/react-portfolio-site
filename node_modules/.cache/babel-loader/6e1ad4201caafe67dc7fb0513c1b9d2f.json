As well as begining the rapid prototypes using static image files and animations. I was the graphic & UI/UX Designer Intern at the company, and later there was a lead designer that came in to help with moving the designs forwards faster. This was very great to learn from this individual and while working with the whole team it really showed me how a team would be able to create a production product.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionblack}>\n      There were a few people in the team. There was a Project manager type person, the CEO who was also a software enginner, a software engineer intern, a data science intern, and me who was graphic & UI/UX design intern, later a lead designer who specalized in User Interface come in to help move the screen along better as well as building out more of the app flows.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>There were alot of difficulties with workingon this application. For example the number of hours we were expected to work for example I was working from 8am to 8pm mon - sat or sometimes they expected me to come in on sundays. It was difficult to get to my internship and although the CEO was a cool guy he didnt seen to understand the basic things that are needed for his workers to be able to be successful. Even so we tried our best and worked to make his dream a reality.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>The User Interface Designs needed to be done, and I pushed hard to get them designed over time, I learned various things to make the designs look better and hopefully made a real difference in how the application would look and feel.
