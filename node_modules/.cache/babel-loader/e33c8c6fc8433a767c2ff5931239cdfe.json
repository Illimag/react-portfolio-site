UIs for people\n            who were not the typical users, as so we thought about how to do that. I decided to focuse on people who has\n            visual problems, either they had difficulties seeing or they were blinded.\n\n            The application that was to be designed to be more inclusive was the Dominos’s Pizza Application.</p>\n          <Image src={Img01} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* img with text */}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <h3>Samsung Voice Assistant</h3>\n          <p>Additionally I created the prototype with AngularJS and HTML/CSS/JS. Now that the application was able to be coded, I\n            decided to use a solution that would use code to implement of a solution for inclusive design. I created some custom code\n            with HTML and CSS that created an indivisible div, that would not be able to be seen in the visual interface.\n\n            The code would be activated using the Samsung Voice Assistant. When the voice assistant was activated, the user can\n            activate the invisible div, will read out the instructions of various things on the app that would be able to able to\n            seen and read the elements.</p>\n          <Image src={Img02} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* text */}\n      <Row className={styles.test1}>\n        <Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n          <h3>High-Fidelity UI Design</h3>\n          <p>Series of various UI designs, Initially I designed some low level mockups that were\n            brought into the fold to be sued on the production application.

Mainly the Personas was for a person whom be blind or visually impaired, hard to see.\n            After the sketches were done, based on the original app. We tried to come up with various solutions that would be\n            able to solve the problems. After the designs were better designed, we did some testing, using user testing, we\n            tested the interface with users and we were able to see what users thought about the application, and we also\n            got a heat map to see where the user would be clicking on the interface.</p>\n          <Image src={Img06} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* Video */}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <video autoPlay preload=\"true\" loop playsInline muted>\n            <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n          </video>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* text */}\n      <Row className={styles.test2}>\n        <Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n          <h3>High-Fidelity UI Design</h3>\n          <p>Series of various UI designs, Initially I designed some low level mockups that were\n            brought into the fold to be sued on the production application.

I wanted\n            an prototype that would be actually usable\n            and then I could implement an additional\n            solution using code.\n\n            So I created the HTML/CSS and JS prototype,\n            implementing with AngularJS. After I created\n            that prototype, I saw that using the andriod\n            device I could activate the voice assistant using\n            certain finger gestures.\n\n            I implemented the invisible CSS div that was\n            able to be only be seen using the voice\n            assistant.</p>\n        </Col>\n        <Col sm>\n          <Image src={Img07} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* codepen*/}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <Codepen\n            hash=\"WNrqqqe\"\n            user=\"jaemnkm\"\n            defaultTab=\"result\"\n            preview={false}\n            height={600}\n          />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* left img right text */}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <Image src={Img08} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n        <Col sm>\n          <h3>Completion of the\n            Prototype</h3>\n          <p>The prototype was created and I was able\n            to present it in class, and I think based\n            on the case files it could be a possible\n            solution for user.</p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* left img right text */}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <Image src={Img09} fluid className=\"pg1Img\" />\n        </Col>\n        <Col sm>\n          <h3>Designing and\n            Implementing</h3>\n          <p>Designing and implementing this prototype\n            gave me a sense of happiness, knowing\n            that I was designing something that would\n            help a Personas that needs more care\n            than others. Im happy to see people being\n            helped, and I think that after I was able to\n            create this interface using code it really opened\n            up more possiblities for a solution that would\n            be possible for user.</p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n\n    <Jumbotron fluid className={styles.bottomNav}>\n      <Container>\n        <Row className={styles.bottomNavColor}>\n          <Col sm={6}>\n            <h1>Sanchez Coffee Co.</h1>\n            <Link to={'/sanchezcoffeeco'}>\n              <h5> View Previous </h5>\n            </Link>\n          </Col>\n          <Col sm={6}>\n            <h1>Stepsaver</h1>\n            <Link to={'/stepsaver'}>\n              <h5> View Next </h5>\n            </Link>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </Jumbotron>\n  </>\n  /* End of JSX Fragment*/\n)"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
