I decided to focuse on people who has\n            visual problems, either they had difficulties seeing or they were blinded.\n\n            The application that was to be designed to be more inclusive was the Dominos’s Pizza Application.</p>\n          <Image src={Img01} fluid className={styles.imgstyle} />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* img with text */}\n      <Row className={styles.test1}>\n        <Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n          <h3>Samsung Voice Assistant</h3>\n          <p>Additionally I created the prototype with AngularJS and HTML/CSS/JS.

I created some custom code\n            with HTML and CSS that created an indivisible div, that would not be able to be seen in the visual interface.\n\n            The code would be activated using the Samsung Voice Assistant. When the voice assistant was activated, the user can\n            activate the invisible div, will read out the instructions of various things on the app that would be able to able to\n            seen and read the elements.</p>\n          <Image src={Img02} fluid className={styles.imgstyle} />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* text */}\n      <Row className={styles.test1}>\n        <Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n          <h3>High-Fidelity UI Design</h3>\n          <p>Series of various UI designs, Initially I designed some low level mockups that were\n            brought into the fold to be sued on the production application.

Mainly the Personas was for a person whom be blind or visually impaired, hard to see.\n            After the sketches were done, based on the original app. We tried to come up with various solutions that would be\n            able to solve the problems. After the designs were better designed, we did some testing, using user testing, we\n            tested the interface with users and we were able to see what users thought about the application, and we also\n            got a heat map to see where the user would be clicking on the interface.</p>\n          <Image src={Img06} fluid className={styles.imgstyle} />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n\n      {/* Video */}\n      <Row>\n        <Col sm>\n          <video autoPlay preload=\"true\" loop playsInline muted>\n            <source src={Vid1} type=\"video/mp4\" />\n          </video>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      {/* text */}\n      <Row className={styles.test2}>\n        <Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n          <h3>High-Fidelity UI Design</h3>\n          <p>Series of various UI designs, Initially I designed some low level mockups that were\n            brought into the fold to be sued on the production application.

I wanted\n            an prototype that would be actually usable\n            and then I could implement an additional\n            solution using code.\n\n            So I created the HTML/CSS and JS prototype,\n            implementing with AngularJS.
