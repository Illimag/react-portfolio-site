I was in charge of doing this and I was able to successfully create the website with a nice minimalist design and implementing this design using CSS onto the wordpress site. Additionally i installed all the plugins for the site.</p>\n     \n      <p className={styles.descriptionblack}>\n      How did I start with the design? First I created some user journeys or I created some personas for people who would use this platform.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionblack}>It was difficult because I would need to work remotely and it became more and more difficult to communicate correctly with my coworkers. Additionally as the sales began coming in it became more difficult to build trust between people whom never really worked together before.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionblack}>What kind of people would be able to use this platform and who wuld want to use this platform.

As well as being able to design it using the WordPress builder plugin and integrating various CSS code Snipets.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>\n      I worked with an remote team, there was a warehouse where the product was being shipped and a team that shipped out the product. Then there was a partner who collaborated with our agent who relayed the instructions to the design and development team who was incharge of the payment infrastructure such as payment gateway, payment processors, merchant accounts, as well as the designs of the logo, products, website design, and wordpress hosting and wordpress development. There were a few people but mainly I was incharge of the website design and development.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>There were alot of dead lines that needed to be accomplished, andwhat we needed to do was create a payment platform as soon as possible that would be able to be sent to PayPay the payment gateway to be able to accept the sales.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>So mainly the task was the design and develop a new site from scratch based on the previous site.
