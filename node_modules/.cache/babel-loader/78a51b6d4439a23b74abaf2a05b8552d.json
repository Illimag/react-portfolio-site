For example the number of hours we were expected to work for example I was working from 8am to 8pm mon - sat or sometimes they expected me to come in on sundays. It was difficult to get to my internship and although the CEO was a cool guy he didnt seen to understand the basic things that are needed for his workers to be able to be successful. Even so we tried our best and worked to make his dream a reality.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>The User Interface Designs needed to be done, and I pushed hard to get them designed over time, I learned various things to make the designs look better and hopefully made a real difference in how the application would look and feel. For example for the Home page of the user interface in the mobile application, I was able to creating the layout and seeing the different parts of the interface that needed to be created.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>We needed to do more research, such as what types of people would be using the interface, we were really focused on creating the MVP. But other that that we really didnt know how this was going to happen. After the interface is becoming better, I started creating a higher fidelity interface.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>I would be putting in the very high number of hours and it began becoming very stressful. Additionally I was For the home page interface after getting the sketch from the CEO and knowing what the layout needed to be I was able to start creating the visual look of the application based on the style guide.</p>\n      <p className={styles.descriptionlargeblack}>I was using tools mainly from adobe such as Illustrator and photoshop. This was before Adobe XD. Additionally I was using rapid prototyping software that was helping me with seeing how the animations of the user Interface would look. This really helped alot when trying to do the Onboarding screens.</p>\n   \n               </Container>\n             }\n\n         </>\n       )}\n     </Media>\n\n\n     \n     \n     </Col>\n   </Row>\n </Container>\n\n\n\n\n <Container fluid>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   {/* img without text */}\n   <Row>\n   <Col sm>\n       <Image src={ImgTablet} fluid className={styles.imgstyle} />\n       <p className={styles.description}>\nInitial sneaker catalog overview\n</p>\n     </Col>\n     <Col sm>\n       <Image src={ImgC} fluid className={styles.imgstyle} />\n       <p className={styles.description}>\nInitial sneaker catalog overview\n</p>\n     </Col>\n   </Row>\n\n\n\n\n   <Row className={styles.test}>\n<Col sm className={styles.fonttest}>\n\n\n<Media queries={{\n small: \"(max-width: 599px)\",\n medium: \"(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1199px)\",\n large: \"(min-width: 1200px)\"\n}}>\n {matches => (\n   <>\n\n     {matches.small &&\n<Container>\n\n <p className={styles.titleblack}>DESIGN:</p>\n <p className={styles.descriptionblack}>When we started to do the design process, it was mainly to do low fidelity prototyping, such as balsamiqs, but preferably started on Adobe Illustrator.
