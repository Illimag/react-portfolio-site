I like how the website changes pages more smoothly because all the assets are preloaded. The downside is that it takes a while at the start to load, the upside is that once the assets are loaded it will be in the cache. I used the iFrame method to change urls when the tab is selected. I think that one of the main issues with using AngularJS for websites is that web crawlers have a more difficult time indexing them. So if you are planning to have your website's SEO effect your internet traffic, a single page application type framework would make the site not SEO friendly. With iFrame method I am able to keep the html in pages that are able to be indexed like a non-framework website. I do not think this is a good way to do things, but for something that is simple like my portfolio which is just a bunch of static photos, an AngularJS framework navigation that changes URLs when each tab is seclted, is an OK solution. angular_test0 navigation is from: https://codepen.io/jasonpaul/pen/BjWPNx angular_test1 navigation is from: https://codepen.io/msorrentino/pen/pypqxJ The main body HTML/CSS/JS is from: http://themes.semicolonweb.com/html/canvas/rs-demo-premium-news.html Revolution Slider: https://revolution.themepunch.com/ 9/30/2018 update: Github pages needs dependencies installed for angular to run.

Clarke writes about a group of monks who are determined to figure out the names of God. They have devised a phonetic alphabet and have written down various combinations of sounds, but they can work only so fast. So, they hire a computer company to install a system that can quickly create 9 billion permutations of the sounds, one of which is likely to be the Name of God. The idea is that, after God's name is known, the world will end.\r\n<br></br>\r\nIt's a charming story, all the more so because desktop computers can now also calculate the name of God, as long as you properly code them with the monk's alphabet, write the program, and then sit and wait for the output to compile.\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe following program uses three nested loops to generate every possible 3-letter combination using the common English alphabet. This example isn't sufficient to produce the Name of God, so the world doesn't end when you run the program.\"\r\n<br></br>\r\nHere is the program that does 17,576 of the 9 billion:\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <Gist id='950e5f0ba955cdbaf665fe1a3791a433' />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat if we need to find all 9 billion?\r\n<br></br>\r\n? - ? = 9,000,000,000\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<Gist id='615c1908218d77f19988134f4a40392e' />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAAAAAAA - ZZZZZZZ = 9,000,000,000 (it's way closer to 8,000,000,000 but let's just say 9,000,000,000)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nHere is the program that does 9 billion:\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<Gist id='4b134b8fedbd964db5432da2e3fb609e' />\r\n\r\n\r\n  </Container>\r\n</Jumbotron>\r\n\r\n</>\r\n      /* End of JSX Fragment*/\r\n)"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
